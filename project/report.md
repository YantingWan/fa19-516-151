# Cloudmesh Cloud AI Service

The project you will be developing a number of services exposing AI capabilities on the cloud. You will be developig a
REST service that invokes an AI functionality in a general term. It is not sufficient to just port an application, but
you must decide which functions are part of the application and port these as collaborating REST services.our
service must be demonstrated on kubernetes and OpenStack showcasing applicability in container and virtual machines. A
deployment, testing, and benchmark activity need t be demonstrated.

## Technical Feasibility

### Operating System
* Mac OS

### Databae

* Mongodb

### REST

* OpenAPI: The REST API will be defined by using OpenAPI specification 
* Swagger editor: The swagger editor is used to write API documentation based on the OpenAPI standard 
* Flask: The web application framework that handles incoming requests
* Connexion: Connexion is an application on the top of Flask that will map the REST API documentation to python functions
on Flask

### Testing
