# Cloudmesh Cloud AI Service

The cloudmesh Cloud Ai service will provide AI capabilities that are running on the different cloud, e.g. chamelon, asure. For the example functions, linear regression, principle components analysis and so on will be provided so that users can utilize the computing power of the clouds to train their models. The cloudmesh cloud AI service will administrate  multiple clouds and determine which cloud to use for scheduled tasks.

## Architecture Design

![architecture](./report-firgures/architecture.svg)

The architecture primarily contains four objects:

* User which is the actor
* The application running on local host using cloudmesh  will manipulate multiple cloud instance, decides delegate computational tasks to which cloud
* The AI services will be running on the Asure, Chameleon, and Chameleon cloud, exposing APIs to incoming requests, and return the return the result to the local host


## Technical Analysis

### Operating System
* Mac OS

### Databae

* Mongodb

### REST

* OpenAPI: The REST API will be defined by using OpenAPI specification 
* Swagger editor: The swagger editor is used to write API documentation based on the OpenAPI standard 
* Flask: The web application framework that handles incoming requests
* Connexion: Connexion is an application on the top of Flask that will map the REST API documentation to python functions
on Flask
* Pytest will be the testing framework

## Progress 

### Week 6

[Qiwei Liu](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Set up flask web application framework
2. Set up the test framework and testing data based using sqlite3
3. Done file upload, list file
4. Set up chameleon instance

[Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Set up connexion, and uses it to map Opean API(yaml) file.
2. Done uploading file locally, testing it on Swagger-ui
3. Done testing a ai function with locally stored dictionary as parameter, testing it on Swagger-ui

### Week 7

[Qiwei Liu](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Update folder structure
2. Gregor update folder structure, refactor file routes, refacter to analytics route

### Code Explanation



## Work Breakdown

## Example Usages

1. Upload a file to the server that will be further processed

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cloudmesh-ai-services/upload" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@learn.rkt"
```



2. Checking the uploaded files

```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/cloudmesh-ai-services/list-files" -H "accept: application/json"
```



3. Contracting a json file which contains the file name, and the parameters for the linear regression to the REST API. The output will be save on the server that could be downloaded.

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cloudmesh-ai-services/linear-regression/linear" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"file_name\":\"string\",\"fit_intercept\":true,\"n_jobs\":0,\"normalize\":true}"
```



The next version will encapsulate the server request command and user can only provide the content body, For exampleï¼Œ

```sh
cloudmesh ai upload "linear_regression.csv"
```
