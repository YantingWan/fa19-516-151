"1 megawatt (MW) of power consumed by a supercomputer today typically requires another 0.7 MW of cooling to offset the heat generated—and **each megawatt of electric power costs approximately US1 million per year.**The Japanese Earth Simulator, for example, ranked as the top supercomputer on the TOP500 list from 2002 to 2004, **consumed 12 MW of power, resulting in US$10 million per year** in operating costs just for powering and cooling. "  — Green Supercomputing Comes of Age

Given the information from the above source,  using the carbon footprint calculator. The results are as follow:

| IT Load (kW):                | 12000 KW   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yearly Cost ($):             | 10 Million |
| Yearly CO2 Footprint (tons): | 10,958,760 |
| CO2 equivalent in cars:      | 4,226,880  |

The carbon emission for a person who lives in a  1b1b, and only travels 14 miles a week by the city bus, in the mean time has no car is about 21550 lbs.

One of the renewable energy used by data centers is the wind energy. As the definition on wiki says, "Wind power or wind energy is the use of air flow through wind turbines to provide the mechanical power to turn electric generators and traditionally to do other work, like milling or pumping."  

Now the containers of Microsoft located at Colorado, Microsoft Virtual Earth, are wind-powered.

China has already put a lot of effort to developed the renewable energy. So far China has been the world's leading country using renewable energy. For example, according to Dong, "In 2017, renewable energy comprised 36.6% of China’s total installed electric power capacity, and 26.4% of total power generation, the vast majority from hydroelectric sources." 

Besides, China is planning  to reform the tax system and "transforming the pollution charge into tax" in order to control the carbon emission. Furthermore, this is not the first time China tries to solve the environmental issues. Currently China is subsidizing the new energy vehicles, so people who decide to buy electric cars will receive a decent discount. In the meantime, people who are going to buy a high emission cars will be heavily taxed due to the higher carbon emission, which will cause more air pollutions. 

In conclusion, China is becoming more active on the climate or environmental issues, and has started to address those problems. The whole society therefore cannot have the equal amount of carbon emission permits as USA, e.g. people are encouraged to buy low-emission cars.

The air-flow cooling system will eventually reach its limit in volume. Instead, utilizing the liquid-cooling system would be a better option as the power-use of data center is dramatically increased.  The liquid-cooling system is passive and it serves the extraction of the heat generated by the air flow. 

The rear door heat exchanger, which using the technology, has an obvious advantages on reducing the operation cost due to its designed  fixed parts that reduces the maintenance cost, in contrast to the computer room air conditioning units. Besides, This technology can even eliminate the chiller operation because its great performance at chilled water set-points.

As the article from nature mentioned,  "Smoother traffic flow and easier carpooling would reduce the total energy demand of the transport industry by 60%." Now the machine learning is used to help optimize traffic and reduce pollution. The research is led by the Berkeley Lab researchers, Alexandre Bayen. He believes that flow smoothing will be standard practice.

As the article from nature says, the power consumption of data center is becoming larger and larger. The total consumption in a year even higher than some small countries. It is worthwhile to address the power issue, because the it is becoming harder by boosting the computer performance. More computers are required to generate the computational power. There needs a structural change, that is, how the hardware is built. 

To recap, to preventing the power consumption of data centers grow too fast than the system can control, measure should be taken to reduce the power usage.

Last week an outage occurred at Amazon AWS located in North Virginia. Even though the backup generator came to work, they failed  after about two hours. 

The outage "impacted 7.5% of EC2 instances and EBS volumes in the Availability Zone." The outage ended up with the data stored  in the instances remained unrecoverable. A company of BleepingComputer whose services relies on the Amazon AWS was heavily affected so that their data became unrecoverable. 

This outage reminds all of the users  to invest in a secondary backup provider regardless of where data is stored.
