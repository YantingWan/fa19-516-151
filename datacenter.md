"1 megawatt (MW) of power consumed by a supercomputer today typically requires another 0.7 MW of cooling to offset the heat generated—and **each megawatt of electric power costs approximately US1 million per year.**The Japanese Earth Simulator, for example, ranked as the top supercomputer on the TOP500 list from 2002 to 2004, **consumed 12 MW of power, resulting in US$10 million per year** in operating costs just for powering and cooling. "  — Green Supercomputing Comes of Age

Given the information from the above source,  using the carbon footprint calculator. The results are as follow:

| IT Load (kW):                | 12 MW      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yearly Cost ($):             | 10 million |
| Yearly CO2 Footprint (tons): | 10,958,760 |
| CO2 equivalent in cars:      | 4,226,880  |

One of the renewable energy used by data centers is the wind energy. As the definition on wiki says, "Wind power or wind energy is the use of air flow through wind turbines to provide the mechanical power to turn electric generators and traditionally to do other work, like milling or pumping."  

Now the containers of Microsoft located at Colorado, Microsoft Virtual Earth, are wind-powered.

China has already put a lot of effort to developed the renewable energy. So far China has been the world's leading country using renewable energy. For example, according to Dong, "In 2017, renewable energy comprised 36.6% of China’s total installed electric power capacity, and 26.4% of total power generation, the vast majority from hydroelectric sources." 

Besides, China is planning  to reform the tax system and "transforming the pollution charge into tax" in order to control the carbon emission. Furthermore, this is not the first time China tries to solve the environmental issues. Currently China is subsidizing the new energy vehicles, so people who decide to buy electric cars will receive a decent discount. In the meantime, people who are going to buy a high emission cars will be heavily taxed due to the higher carbon emission, which will cause more air pollutions. 

In conclusion, China is becoming more active on the climate or environmental issues, and has started to address those problems. The whole society therefore cannot have the equal amount of carbon emission permits as USA, e.g. people are encouraged to buy low-emission cars.
